# Portfolio-Starter-Pack

I’m an aspiring data analyst with a growing interest in how data can be used to support better decision-making in real-world environments.
I enjoy working with data to uncover patterns, answer questions, and communicate insights clearly. My goal is to build practical, ethical, 
and well-documented data projects as I grow my skills.

Target Role

Target Role: Data Analyst

I am currently aiming for a data analyst role because it allows me to build a strong foundation in data cleaning, exploration, visualisation, and storytelling. 
This role aligns with my curiosity about how data is used across industries to explain trends, support strategy, and improve outcomes.
Right now, my focus is on developing core analytical skills before progressing toward more advanced data science or machine learning roles.

Seed Project Ideas

Project Idea 1:
Analyse a public dataset (such as retail sales or customer transactions) to identify trends, seasonality, and key performance indicators. 
The project will focus on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and clear visualisation of insights.

Project Idea 2:
Explore a real-world dataset related to public services or social data (e.g. crime, health, or education statistics) to identify patterns and regional differences. 
This project will emphasise responsible data use and clear communication of findings.

Skills to Grow

Technical Skill:
Python for data analysis (using libraries such as pandas and matplotlib). This skill is essential for a data analyst role and will help me efficiently clean, analyse, and visualise data.

Soft Skill:
Data communication and storytelling. I want to improve my ability to explain insights clearly to non-technical audiences using visuals and simple language.

Goals

30-Day Goal:
Complete a beginner-to-intermediate Python or SQL course and apply the skills to a small dataset published on GitHub.

6-Month Goal:
Build and publish at least one complete data analysis project on my GitHub Pages portfolio, including a clear problem statement, analysis, visualisations, and written insights.
